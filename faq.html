A request for cancellation must have been provided in writing by email to sugarcon2016@sugarcrm.com and the cancellation was effective upon receipt by SugarCRM, provided that such written notice of cancellation was received by February 20, 2016. Cancellations within 60 days of the first day of the Event are non-refundable, and paid attendees who did not attend or who canceled after the deadline of February 20, 2016 were liable for the entire fee.</p><br>

However, if the requested transfer was received within 30 days of the first day of the Event, such request would have required a payment of a $50 transfer fee.</p><br>
